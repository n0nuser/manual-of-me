                    For Consuls, life is sweetest when it’s shared with others. People with this personality type form
                    the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes - and their hearts - to friends, loved ones,
                    and neighbors.

                    Consuls do believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of
                    duty to those around them.
                    Generous and reliable, they often take it upon themselves - in ways
                    both large and small - to hold their families and their communities together.

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#:~:text=the%20current%20opinion,8%5D%5B9%5D">Dopamine</a>. I usually find that after doing something that risens my dopamine, getting to other things not
                so pleasent is very difficult. This is normal for everyone because it's how the chemistry in our brains
                works,
                but I try to fight that by doing the hardest things the first.</li>

                tend to pursue new more interesting things while I already have some incredible things going around.
                While this might seem fine to many people, often it isn't. I'm working on my consistency and discipline.
